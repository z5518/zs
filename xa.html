        <h1>Mastering Work Techniques</h1>
        <p>This page explains how to better present Boralex when inviting new members and how to make your promotional work smoother. Please read all the content on this page carefully.</p>

        <p>Many people simply say: "Sign up through my link, join my team, and rent a machine; you can then earn money." If you only provide this presentation, you probably won't convince them, and they won't be interested in joining your team.</p>

        <h2>Now, suppose I am you. Here's how I would present Boralex to new members when inviting them to join:</h2>
        <p>First, I would send a video about Boralex:</p>

        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-xWlNeK3NIY" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <p>After sending the video, I would briefly introduce Boralex to the new members:</p>

        <p>Boralex was founded in 1990. It's a listed company that has been around for 35 years. It's the largest clean - energy company in countries like the UK, France, Canada, and the US, and is a world leader in wind and solar energy production. We design and sell high - performance, reliable solar cells, modules, and photovoltaic (PV) systems to residential, commercial, government, and utility customers.</p>

        <p>Solar energy has become an essential part of our daily lives. It’s widely used for electricity generation, heating, and lighting. Not only does it make life more convenient, but it also plays a huge role in protecting the environment.Our company’s vision is to promote solar power globally—bringing convenience to people while protecting the environment.</p>

        <p>Your job is to help us promote brand awareness and products. Spreading solar energy will not only benefit the future solution to Africa's energy shortage but also allow you to earn substantial income during the promotion process.</p>

        <h1></h1>

        <p><strong>After presenting the company, they might ask you: "What is Boralex? What should I do after joining Boralex?" You can respond as follows:</strong></p>

        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/xcygdAc.jpeg" alt="Cosmic Image">

        <p>Boralex earns money through the electricity produced by its solar equipment. Solar energy is essential in our daily lives, used to produce electricity and heat. Currently, Boralex is recruiting more part-time individuals to help promote the brand. Your main job will be to promote the company's products. This will not only solve the energy shortage problem in Africa, bringing convenience and environmental protection, but you will also receive a good remuneration for your promotional efforts.</p>

        <p><strong>Next, you can present the company's products and how to earn income.</strong></p>

        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/uGGM4DB.jpeg" alt="Cosmic Image">

        <p>Here are some of our current products. By renting a machine, you become an official member of Boralex. After the rental, a specialized technician will put your machine into service. You just need to log into your Boralex account each day, which takes a minute, and you will receive the income generated by the machine.</p>

        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/GDsWOWW.png" alt="Cosmic Image">

        <p>↪️ For example, with the B-4 machine, you pay 400 ZMW to rent it, and you receive 16.8 ZMW per day for 50 days, totaling 840 ZMW.</p>

        <p>If it's a person with limited means, you can give the example of the B-2 machine at 200 ZMW, emphasizing: "<strong>Although the B-2 machine only brings you 8 ZMW per day, the important thing is that you get a job opportunity. Many members who rent the B-2 machine end up earning more than 300 ZMW per day through their efforts.</strong>"</p>

        <p>Conversely, if your client has more financial means and you fear that the income from the B-2 machine may not interest them, and you also wish to obtain more rewards and commissions, you can give them the example of a higher-quality machine.</p>

        <h1></h1>

        <p>Using flexible promotion methods will make your work more effective and arouse more interest from clients. Of course, regardless of the machine rented, all members are equal at Boralex. Boralex treats every member fairly. We have the same job opportunities, and our rewards depend on our personal efforts.</p>

        <p>At that point, new members might ask you: "Is this an investment?" You can clearly answer: "No! If you join Boralex and rent a machine, Boralex will grant you the right to enjoy the machine's profits each day. More importantly, you will get a great job opportunity." Then, you can send them the following content:</p>

        <p>By renting a machine, not only will you receive daily income from the machine, but you can also earn money by promoting. Through this collaboration, the company's brand awareness and value will constantly increase. In the future, with the brand's influence, we will change the African market. When people think of electricity, they will think of Boralex. So, it's a win-win situation that will allow us to have a stable and lasting cooperation with Boralex.</p>

        <p>When someone rents a machine thanks to your recommendation, you immediately receive a referral bonus. Some people earn up to 500 ZMW per day thanks to Boralex. So, by renting a machine and joining Boralex, not only will you receive daily income from the machine, but you can also earn more money by working part-time.</p>

        <p>This is the right way to present Boralex. Of course, I have simply shown you how to present Boralex in general. You can also use your own method or combine mine with yours. I'm sure this will make your promotional work smoother, allowing you to earn more income.</p>

        <h1></h1>

        <p><strong>Of course, in addition to properly presenting Boralex, we must also know what is most important in promotional work.</strong></p>

        <p><strong style="color:red;">1️⃣Effective Promotion</strong></p>

        <p>Only effective promotion can bring you more registered clients. It's only by obtaining more registered users through effective promotion that you will have the opportunity to convince them to join your team and rent a machine.</p>

        <p>Therefore, it's essential to carry out effective promotion to arouse others' interest, because if you don't do effective promotion, no one will register through your link, and there will be no question of joining your team.</p>

        <p><strong>So, how to carry out effective promotion❓</strong></p>

        <p style="color:blue;">Online Promotion Methods</p>

<p>Using platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, etc. Post engaging content by combining images, videos, and your own presentation texts.</p>

<p style="color:blue;">Offline Promotion Methods</p>

<p>Distribute flyers and posters in targeted areas and during various events to increase promotional exposure. Sponsor or participate in community activities to boost brand awareness. Organize conferences and seminars to share industry knowledge and attract potential clients.</p>

<p>Effective promotion is very important, because if you find that some of your content or promotional methods don’t even appeal to you, they naturally won’t attract others either.</p>

<h1></h1>

<p><strong style="color:red;">2️⃣ Clear Presentation:</strong></p>

<p>Use the above methods to present Boralex and send more materials about Boralex to your clients, such as images or videos, to introduce Boralex in more detail, spark greater interest, and convince your clients.</p>

<p>Many people simply send written descriptions or make phone presentations. Unless you have exceptional persuasive skills, a person won’t choose to join your team based on just a few texts or a simple phone call.</p>

<p>It’s very important to present Boralex clearly and effectively to a client. It’s like wanting to buy a car. You ask the seller for information, and they just say, “This car is very good, it drives.” You probably wouldn’t be interested, because they haven’t explained the benefits of the car or the many features it offers.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if another seller tells you in detail: “This car is equipped with the latest safety systems, which effectively protect you and your family. It’s very fuel-efficient, consuming only 6 liters per 100 kilometers. Additionally, it has a luxurious interior with leather seats and a high-quality sound system. You can enjoy a comfortable driving experience and quality music.” and also shows you detailed images and videos of the car.</p>

<p>With this comparison, which one would you be more inclined to choose? Obviously, it’s the one who provided a detailed explanation of the car’s advantages and features. Because they not only answered your questions but also offered valuable information, allowing you to clearly understand the value and benefits of the car.</p>

<h1></h1>

<p><strong style="color:red;">3️⃣ Continuous Follow-Up</strong></p>

<p>Ensure continuous follow-up with those who registered through your link but haven’t rented a system. Many people will refuse, or even after a detailed presentation, your clients may still hesitate. I’m sure you’ve all encountered this kind of issue.</p>

<p>Don’t be discouraged by this—it’s very common in the field of sales.</p>

<p>It’s like wanting to buy a phone. The store owner actively and thoroughly presents the phone’s advantages, but you still hesitate for various reasons.</p>

<p>Let’s use an example to show the importance of continuously following up with clients.</p>

<p>Suppose you have a friend named Pierre who is very interested in the content you sent him. You recommend Boralex and explain in detail the company’s background, its products, and income opportunities. Pierre shows interest, but since he’s not familiar with this field, he hesitates to join.</p>

<p>You don’t give up. From time to time, you contact Pierre to provide more information about Boralex, such as new products, company news, success stories from other members, as well as videos and images.</p>

<p>After several follow-ups, Pierre finally decides to join Boralex. He starts earning income by promoting products and recruiting new members. He also recommends Boralex to his friends, which helps your team grow stronger and stronger.</p>

<p>I’m giving you this example to show that by following up continuously, you can overcome potential clients’ hesitation and doubts and turn them into loyal clients and promoters. This is crucial for your success with Boralex.</p>

<h1></h1>

<p>Many people don’t believe in themselves, lack confidence. What seems impossible is simply something that hasn’t yet been achieved—just like there was no path in the world until someone walked it. Once you take the first step, the impossible becomes possible. Believe in yourself, dare to face challenges, and you will break through all barriers, surpass yourself, and ultimately turn the impossible into your greatest success.</p>

<p>Don’t let anyone put you down, not even yourself! We must understand that: <strong style="color:red;">"Water dripping continuously can pierce stone—not by force, but by perseverance."</strong></p>

<p>This is the training content on this page. I’m sure that after reading it, you’ll find great help and inspiration for your work. If you want to change yourself, don’t just imagine—action is key. — <strong style="color:red;">"Actions speak louder than words."</strong></p>
